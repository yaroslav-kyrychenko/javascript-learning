# Modal window

## Project description

- This project has been done based on the Guess My Number project in the _'The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert!'_ course on Udemy.
- html and css files were written by the author of the course and attached to the source materials, hence, I did not write any of the html or css.

## What does it do?

- If any of the 'Show modal #' buttons is pressed, a modal window is displayed with a lorem ipsum placeholder.
- Apart from the window, overlay with the blur is also activated.
- If a close button is pressed, any place on the overlay is clicked on or an 'Esc' key is pressed, the modal window gets hidden.
