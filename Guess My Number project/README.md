# Project description

- This project has been done based on the Guess My Number project in the *'The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert!'* course on Udemy. 
- The code differs from the one used in the course as some refactoring changes have been made. 
- I may update the project in the future with new features.
