# Guess My Number game project
## Project description

- This project has been done based on the Guess My Number project in the *'The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert!'* course on Udemy. 
- html and css files were written by the author of the course and attached to the source materials, hence, I did not write any of the html or css.
- The code differs from the one used in the course as some refactoring changes have been made. 
- I may update the project in the future with new features.

## What does it do?
- A number is randomly generated.
- Player puts a number between 1 and 20 to the input (guess) field.
- The code evaluates whether the number is equal to a randomly generated number.
- If it is equal, the style of the page changes, the winning message is displayed and the highscore is updated (or not, depending whether the player has actually beaten the highscore).
- If it is not equal, 'Guess again' message is displayed.
- If the player does not guess the number correctly after 20 attempts, the game is over.
